Steps of design:

Single model view =>
1.	Created Models folder in that created class which represents structure of database. 
2.	Created Data folder in that added ApplicationDbContext
3.	Create controller -> Add XYZ.cs as controller class
4.	Added asociated view to controller
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple model view =>

1.	Created Books Class which is our second model
2.	Added relation at in Book class inside the #region  section. Here now each book has information about its category
3.	Added relation in category class inside the #region section by creating the collection of books in it for each class. 
	Now child knows who is the parent and parent has the information about his childrens.
4.  Run the migration and update the database.

Now to display the number of books for each category item we added one one column namely "Available books" in "Areas/LibraryMngt/Categories/index.cshtml"
It will show only the column bbut data foer that column is comming from Categories Coontroller hence go to CategoriesController.cs and modify the return state ment in such way that it will also give me the amount of books for that perticular category.
Add .Include(c=> c.Books) in return statement and make it as :: "return View(await _context.Categories.Include(c=> c.Books).ToListAsync());"

Now you will get the nit and clean UI with additional column named as Available Books and it will display the count of books associated with that perticular category.

UI setup part:

UI part is controlled from _Layout.cshtml file. Hence go there and create one more lable with dropdown
We have created the Dropdown menu Namely "Admin"
paste below code for that::

<li class="nav-item dropdown">
    <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="#"> Admin</a>
    <div class="dropdown-menu">
        <a class="dropdown-item" asp-area="LibraryMngt" asp-controller="Categories" asp-action="Index"> Categories</a>
        <a class="dropdown-item" asp-area="LibraryMngt" asp-controller="Books" asp-action="Index"> Books</a>
    </div>

</li>
